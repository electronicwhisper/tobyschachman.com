Behind my desk at CDG (the Communications Design Group) is our Representation Gallery. It's a wall-sized collage of representations--the notational, diagrammatic, and graphical systems that people use to communicate and reflect on their thoughts. The disciplines span music, maps, chemistry, biology, mathematics, electronics, etc.

I love bringing visitors to this gallery because they always latch onto one of the specimens and begin discussing an esoteric interest they've never mentioned to me. Or they point out a connection between two representations that I'd never noticed before. It's like all the different ways-of-thinking, usually confined within isolated thought contexts ("disciplines"), getting to meet and mingle at a ways-of-thinking party.

Our representations serve us. They extend our cognitive apparatus, enabling us to think in ways that we would not be able to without them. In 14th century Europe, multiplication was a skill possessed only by the mathematically elite. Then Arabic numerals replaced Roman numerals and multiplication became an idea accessible to anyone.

At the same time, representations are not our thoughts. Representations *channel* our thoughts. And we can invent new representations in order to channel our thoughts in new directions.

Inventing new representations is hard because it is hard to detach our thoughts from how we represent them. We conflate the fundamental activity with its external appearance.

For example, we tend to conflate the *activity* of programming--specifying the behavior of a system--with the *representation* of textual code. We think programming *is* coding. This is the same trap as conflating mathematical reasoning with the symbols drawn on school chalkboards.

## Radical Representations

The word "radical" is taken to mean dramatically new or different, but the word stems from Latin *radix* meaning *root*. In this sense, a radical thought is not new, it is old. A thought that returns to the root.
