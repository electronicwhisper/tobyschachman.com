<div class="Centered"><div class="Title">Spinning Beach Ball of Death</div>
<div class="Date">December 15th, 2012</div>

<p>I made this piece for <a href="http://www.arthackday.net/events/lethal-software">Art Hack Day: Lethal Software</a> hosted by <a href="http://grayarea.org/">GAFFTA</a> in San Francisco. The piece was installed in a small nook, only wide enough for one person to enter.</p>
<p><img src="instructions.jpg" class="FullScreenImage"></p>
<p>I put an LED and photocell on the headphones to detect when the viewer put them on. After some moments, the spinning ball would begin pulsating into a mandala. The animation would reset when the headphones came off.</p>
<p>The soundtrack is <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/800-slower-time-stretch">Justin Bieber - U Smile (800% slower)</a>.</p>
<p>The piece is based on an idea from the book You Are Here by Thich Nhat Hanh.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Stop! The street sign reminds you. Stop running, because life is here, in the present moment. We have to train in that. As you breath out, you say: &#x201C;I am home.&#x201D; I am already home, I don&#x2019;t have to run. I am at home, in my true home. The address of my true home is clear: life, here and now. Peace is something that becomes possible the moment you stop.</p>
