Changes to presentation
  Have a small explainer on composition and ordering
    Show Compose Sine Fract and Compose Fract Sine
  Maybe have a slide showing overview of the noise function construction process steps (i.e. custom functions)
    Random, Step Random, Noise, Fractal Noise



Changes to system
  Rotate modifier
  Snap on/off modifier
  When you create a new fn, give it the plot of the currently editing fn







Architecture
  Move "builtIn" into its own file.
  Move "combiners" into their own thing. Think of better name.


Misc
  Figure out how React context works
  Do something better than util.safeInv
  Tune mousewheel zooming
  Delete key
  Undo
  Duplicate
  Check that you don't create dependency loops
  Need to listen for scroll events on Scrollers and refresh

Dirty system
  Should have a thing for keeping track of whether certain things might be dirty, ala the Compiler.






Plot
  Better "settings" controls
  Clean up hard coded stuff in plot layout
  ColorMap needs to be dimensionally generic





Outline Stuff
  Create definition button / right click item - create by abstracting
  Show transform numbers when they're not identity?


Inspector
  Highlight transform numbers when hovering the control point
  Show transform numbers next to control point
  Scrub transform numbers in inspector?


Palette
  Insert button
  Anything can be dragged into the outline to put it in a specific place
  Maybe
    + insert buttons in outline like before
  Some way to delete definitions









Nice to have
  flexible color scale for colorMap

  rotate/scale modifier when dragging transform points

  performance
    send in selectedChildFn transforms as uniforms into shaders to make dragging control points faster

  highlight hovered/active transform variables

  spread based on the hovered transform point/variable(s)

  maybe a hover in "window" view for colorMap

  look into changing data model / API for childFn to make control point code less ugly
