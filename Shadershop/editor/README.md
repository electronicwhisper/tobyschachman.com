## Build Instructions

Install [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) and [coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/).

Run `npm install` in this directory to install the development dependencies.

Run `coffee build.coffee` to build. It will compile the files in `src` into `compiled/app.js` and `compiled/app.css`. It will also automatically watch for changes in `src` files and recompile as necessary.

Now just open `index.html`. You can also open `dev.html` which uses the development version of React and will give you better console warnings.
